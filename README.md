# VeganProductSim
A project to learn agent based modelling. Trying to model the effects of different kinds of consumers on environmentally concious products.

Mainly a test project for learning agent based modelling. This project is currently on hiatus due to university work but the most recent updates are in the genetic algorithm (genetic.py).
